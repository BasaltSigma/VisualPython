# VisualPython
Software to run a custom visual programming language based on the Python library. 
## Description
This software is intended to be a learning tool for beginner programmers to visualize code layout and flow graphically rather than textually. Inspired from Unreal Engine 4 Blueprints. The code creates an editor using `tkinter` and processes the entire 'blueprint' upon clicking the "Run" button.

**NOTE:** This is in its very early stages of development. If you would like to contribute, flick me an email on kris91268@gmail.com
